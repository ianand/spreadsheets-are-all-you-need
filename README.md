Spreadsheets-are-all-you-need implements the forward pass of GPT2 (an ancestor of ChatGPT) entirely in Excel using standard spreadsheet functions.

By using a spreadsheet anyone (even non-developers) can explore and play directly with how a “real” transformer works under the hood with minimal abstractions to get in the way.
